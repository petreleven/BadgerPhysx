# Badger PhysX

Badger PhysX is a versatile, rendering-agnostic physics engine designed to support both 2D and 3D simulations. Drawing heavily on concepts from Ian Millington's books, it offers a solid foundation for implementing robust physics solutions in diverse projects.

The name *Badger PhysX* pays homage to the Badgermole from *Avatar: The Last Airbender*, a creature celebrated for its strength and adaptabilityâ€”qualities this engine aspires to deliver in the field of physics simulation.

## Features

- **2D & 3D Physics**: Effortlessly switch between 2D and 3D simulation modes.
- **Rendering Agnostic**: Integrate seamlessly with any rendering pipeline for maximum flexibility.
- **Modular Design**: Built for easy customization and scalability, allowing you to tailor the engine to your specific needs.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To start using Badger PhysX, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
